I am a research staff in the Data Intensive Computing Group at Texas Advanced Computing Center.

Before joining TACC, I spent two years as a postdoc researcher in AMPLab and BIDS (Berkeley Institute of Data Science) at University of California, Berkeley, working with Prof. Michael J. Franklin. I received my Ph.D from Department of Computer Science at University of Chicago in June, 2014 under the supervision of Prof. Ian Foster.
