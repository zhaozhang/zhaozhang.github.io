I am an assistant professor in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.rutgers.edu/) at Rutgers University. Before joining Rutgers, I was a computer scientist in the Data Intensive Computing Group at Texas Advanced Computing Center. From 2014 to 2016, I spent two years as a postdoc researcher in AMPLab and BIDS (Berkeley Institute of Data Science) at University of California, Berkeley, working with Prof. Michael J. Franklin. I received my Ph.D from Department of Computer Science at University of Chicago in June, 2014 under the supervision of Prof. Ian Foster.
