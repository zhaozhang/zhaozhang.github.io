This is a cross-listed (graduate level course with the focus of system perspectives in distributed deep learning. The goal of this course is to develop comprehen- sive and deep understanding of internals of deep learning systems to inspire and foster studentsâ€™ future research direction. This course covers a wide range of topics of neural network architecture, optimization methods, parallel training paradigms, high-performance computing architecture, and communication algo- rithms. This course conveys the principles of distributed/parallel system design with the state-of-the-art deep learning progress.
